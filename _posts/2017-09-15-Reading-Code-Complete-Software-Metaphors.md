# Software Metaphors

### Metaphors are heuristic instead of deterministic

### Oyster Farming: Incremental Development

* In incremental development, you first make the simplest possible version of the system that will run. It doesn’t have to accept realistic input, it doesn’t have to perform realistic manipulations on data, it doesn’t have to produce realistic output—it just hasto be a skeleton strong enough to hold the real system as it’s developed. It might call dummy classes for each of the basic functions you have identified. This basic beginning is like the oyster’s beginning a pearl with a small grain of sand.
* After you’ve formed the skeleton, little by little you lay on the muscle and skin. You change each of the dummy classes to real classes. Instead of having your program pretend to accept input, you drop in code that accepts real input. Instead of having your program pretend to produce output, you drop in code that produces real output. You add a little bit of code at a time until you have a fully working system.

### Building Software

* You just lose an afternoon if you forget to build a door for a doghouse, but it costs you much more if you need to move a wall in a house for 6 inched.
* You won't try to build things you can buy.
